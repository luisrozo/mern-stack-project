This is a personal project in order to improve personal skills using the MERN Stack:

- MongoDB
- Express
- React (with Redux)
- node.js

## Project structure

The project is divided into different sub-projects; each of them has a different topic and uses different technologies. The sub-projects are:

* **GifExpertApp**. A simple app which fetchs gifs from the Giphy API from an user-input search and display that gifs.
* *More projects under construction...*

Each project has its own unit and integration tests.
